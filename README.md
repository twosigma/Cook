# Cook Scheduler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/Cook.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/Cook)

Welcome to Two Sigma's Cook Scheduler!

What is Cook?

- Cook is a powerful batch scheduler, specifically designed to provide a great user experience when there are more jobs to run than your cluster has capacity for.
- Cook is able to intelligently preempt jobs to ensure that no user ever needs to wait long to get quick answers, while simultaneously helping you to achieve 90%+ utilization for massive workloads.
- Cook has been battle-hardened to automatically recover after dozens of classes of cluster failures.
- Cook can act as a Spark scheduler, and it comes with a REST API and Java client.

[Core concepts](scheduler/docs/concepts.md) is a good place to start to learn more.

## Subproject Summary

In this repository, you'll find several subprojects, each of which has its own documentation.

* `scheduler` - This is the actual Mesos framework, Cook. It comes with a JSON REST API.
* `jobclient` - This is the Java API for Cook, which uses the REST API under the hood.
* `spark` - This contains the patch to Spark to enable Cook as a backend.

Please visit the `scheduler` subproject first to get started.
