# Cook Scheduler

[![Slack Status](http://cookscheduler.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](http://cookscheduler.herokuapp.com/)

Welcome to Two Sigma's Cook Scheduler!

What is Cook?

- Cook is a powerful batch scheduler, specifically designed to provide a great user experience when there are more jobs to run than your cluster has capacity for.
- Cook is able to intelligently preempt jobs to ensure that no user ever needs to wait long to get quick answers, while simultaneously helping you to achieve 90%+ utilization for massive workloads.
- Cook has been battle-hardened to automatically recover after dozens of classes of cluster failures.
- Cook can act as a Spark scheduler, and it comes with a [REST API](https://github.com/twosigma/Cook/blob/master/scheduler/docs/scheduler-rest-api.adoc), [Java client](https://github.com/twosigma/Cook/tree/master/jobclient/java/src/main/java/com/twosigma/cook/jobclient), [Python client](https://github.com/twosigma/Cook/tree/master/jobclient/python), and [CLI](https://github.com/twosigma/Cook/tree/master/cli).

[Core concepts](scheduler/docs/concepts.md) is a good place to start to learn more.

## Releases 

Check the [changelog](scheduler/CHANGELOG.md) for release info.

## Subproject Summary

In this repository, you'll find several subprojects, each of which has its own documentation.

* `scheduler` - This is the actual Mesos framework, Cook. It comes with a JSON REST API.
* `jobclient` - This includes the Java and Python APIs for Cook, both of which use the REST API under the hood.
* `spark` - This contains the patch to Spark to enable Cook as a backend.

Please visit the `scheduler` subproject first to get started.

## Quickstart

### Using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

The quickest way to get Cook running locally against [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) is with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

1. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
1. [Install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Clone down this repo
1. Run `GCP_PROJECT_NAME=<gcp_project_name> vagrant up --provider=virtualbox` to create the dev environment
1. Run `vagrant ssh` to ssh into the dev environment

#### In your Vagrant dev environment

1. Run `gcloud auth login` to login to Google cloud
1. Run `bin/make-gke-test-clusters` to create GKE clusters
1. Run `bin/start-datomic.sh` to start Datomic (Cook database)
1. Run `lein exec -p datomic/data/seed_k8s_pools.clj $COOK_DATOMIC_URI` to seed some Cook pools in the database
1. Run `bin/run-local-kubernetes.sh` to start the Cook scheduler
1. Cook should now be listening locally on port 12321

To test a simple job submission:

1. Run `cs submit --pool k8s-alpha --cpu 0.5 --mem 32 --docker-image gcr.io/google-containers/alpine-with-bash:1.0 ls` to submit a simple job
1. Run `cs show <job_uuid>` to show the status of your job (it should eventually show Success)

To run automated tests:

1. Run `lein test :all-but-benchmark` to run unit tests
1. Run `cd ../integration && pytest -m 'not cli'` to run integration tests
1. Run `cd ../integration && pytest -k test_basic_submit -n 0 -s` to run a particular integration test

### Using Mesos

The quickest way to get Mesos and Cook running locally is with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [minimesos](https://minimesos.org/). 

1. Install `docker`
1. Clone down this repo
1. `cd scheduler`
1. Run `bin/build-docker-image.sh` to build the Cook scheduler image
1. Run `../travis/minimesos up` to start Mesos and ZooKeeper using minimesos
1. Run `bin/run-docker.sh` to start the Cook scheduler
1. Cook should now be listening locally on port 12321
