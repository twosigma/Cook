# Cook Simulator

This project is a CLI interface to generated simulated workloads, to run them against a real instance of Cook, and to report on how the jobs in a given simulation were handled.

## Example usage

First, edit your intended settings file (e.g. config/settings.edn) as you see fit.
Since the program exits after each command, you'll need to be running against a
Datomic with persistent storage.
