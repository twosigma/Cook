;;; Offer buffer Design
;;; The offer buffer is used to store mesos resource offers made to cook until the matcher is
;;; ready to use them.
;;;
;;; Reasons for doing this:
;;;  <> We can combine offers between offer sets
;;;  <> Provide the matcher with the best (biggest) offer of all possible offers currently ready
;;;  <> Lay the foundation for additional criteria before the offer is ready for the matcher
;;;  <> Centralize outstanding offers
;;;
;;; Structure:
;;; We have three components that do the heavy lifting.
;;;   1. offer-incubator: Accepts new offers from mesos and allows them to 'incubate',
;;;                       meaning we wait some amount of time before we consider the
;;;                       offer ready for the matcher. We delay the offers in the hopes
;;;                       of combining them with other offers from the same host. When offers
;;;                       are done incubating, we attempt to combine with other offers and
;;;                       pass the combined offers to the prioritizer.
;;;   2. offer-prioritizer: Accepts offers from the incubator that are ready and sorts them by size.
;;;                         Ensures the largest offer is passed to the offer-matcher when requested.
;;;   3. offer-matcher: Pulls offers from the offer-prioritizer and calls `handle-resource-offer!`
;;;
;;; Interesting design points:
;;; <> The incubator puts a timer on each offer set (call `incubate!`) and once the timer is up,
;;;    it puts the ids onto a channel to notify the incubator to attempt to combine offers and
;;;    pass along to the prioritizer.
;;; <> Once an offer has incubated, we take it, plus any offers that can combine with it out of
;;;    the buffer and put it onto the `offer-ready-chan`. This means we can be in a position where
;;;    a later timer fires and some of the offers are no longer in the buffer. We handle this by
;;;    using `select-keys` as a set intersection between offers we are considering and offers that
;;;    still exist in the buffer.
;;; <> To avoid race conditions, the design is fully linearized using `async/alt!`. The sole exception
;;;    is the incubate timers, however the firing of the timer is used only to notify that incubating
;;;    is complete. Since the work of moving the incubated offers to the next stage of the pipeline is
;;;    handled linearly through the `async/alt!` block, there is no concern of a race with the timers
;;;    as well.
