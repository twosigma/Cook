;;; Design
;;; Rebalancer is designed to run independently of the scheduler. Its primary functionality is to detect that
;;; the cluster is unbalanced, and if so, to balance the cluster by performing preemption of lesser prioirty tasks.
;;;
;;; Definitions
;;; The cluster is balanced when the allocated resources for each user are above or close to its weighted fair share
;;; allocation; similarly, the cluster is unbalanced when there exists a user whose allocated resources are below and
;;; not close to its weighted fair share allocation.
;;;
;;; To preempt a task is to stop and requeue a task.
;;;
;;; A job is a work request, whereas a task is a realization of a job. A job can have many tasks. A job can be in one
;;; of three states: pending; running; completed, encompassing both success and failure states. A task can be in one of
;;; two states: running or completed, again encompassing both success and failure states.
;;;
;;; Lifecycle of Rebalancer
;;; Rebalancer runs periodically with a fixed time period. Each period consists of a single cycle, which consists of
;;; multiple iterations.
;;;
;;; At the start of a cycle, Rebalancer initializes its internal state. Then, for each iteration in a given cycle,
;;; Rebalancer processes a pending job and tries to make room for it by finding a task to preempt and updates its
;;; internal state if such preemption is found.
;;;
;;; Preemption Principle
;;; Rebalancer uses a score-based preemption algorithm.
;;;
;;; Each running task and pending job has a score. The higher the score, the more important the task/job is. The
;;; preemption principle is to preempt low score running tasks to make room for high score pending jobs. In this
;;; implementation, score is defined as the negative of dominant resource usage (DRU). The higher the DRU, the more
;;; likely it is a task will be preempted.
;;;
;;; Dominant Resource Usage (DRU)
;;; The idea of DRU is introduced in https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf. In the paper, the DRU of a user
;;; is defined as
;;;
;;;                           (max (/ used-mem total-mem)   (/ used-cpus total-cpus)).
;;;
;;; We slightly modify it to be
;;;
;;;                           (max (/ used-mem mem-divisor) (/ used-cpus cpus-divisor)).
;;;
;;; We introduce mem-divisor and cpus-divisor because it gives us the flexibility to change how individual resources
;;; impact score. For instance, if we believe our cluster is memory bound, we can set mem-divisor to (* 0.1 total-mem)
;;; and cpus-divisor to (* 0.3 total-cpus) to encode our belief that memory 3x as precious as cpu. Conveniently, we can
;;; set each respective divisor to per user per resource share, which gives us a weighted DRU.
;;;
;;; DRU of a Running Task
;;; Assume there is a per user ordering of tasks. We define DRU of a task to be the resource sum of this task and all
;;; tasks before it divided by the respecitve DRU divisor.
;;;
;;; For instance, suppose user A has ordered running tasks
;;;
;;;                        [{:task taskA :mem 10.0 :cpus 2.0} {:task taskB :mem 5.0 :cpus 1.0}].
;;;
;;; Assuming both DRU divisors are 100.0, then the corresponding DRUs are
;;;
;;;                        [{:task taskA :dru 0.1}            {:task taskB :dru 0.15}].
;;;
;;; The DRU of user A's tasks is a function of A's running tasks and DRU divisors. It is not affected by other users'
;;; running tasks.
;;;
;;; DRU of a Pending Job
;;; We define the DRU of a pending job to be the CUMULATIVE DRU of the running task of this pending job, were it to be launched.
;;;
;;; Continuing with the example above, suppose user A has jobs jobA, jobB, and jobC, where jobA and jobB are running,
;;; as implied above, and jobC is pending. jobC is
;;;
;;;                                       {:job jobC :mem 17.0 :cpus 3.0}
;;;
;;; and User A's task ordering function specifies that were jobC to be launched as taskC, then user A's new ordered
;;; running tasks would be
;;;
;;;         [{:task taskA :mem 10.0 :cpus 2.0} {:task taskC :mem 17.0 :cpus 3.0} {:task taskB :mem 5.0 :cpus 1.0}],
;;;
;;; which would imply that taskC would have a DRU of 0.27.
;;;
;;; For GPU preemption, the functionality works exactly the same as above, with one change: instead of computing the DRU
;;; as (max (/ used-mem mem-divisor) (/ used-cpus cpu-divisor)), we compute the DRU as (/ used-gpus gpu-divisor). All of
;;; the different code paths reflect this change, or the fact that GPU scored task pairs are [task cumulative-gpus] rather
;;; than [task scored-task], as we don't need the additional data for computing the GPU preemption.
;;;
;;; Parameters
;;; safe-dru-threshold: Task with a DRU lower than safe-dru-threshold will not be preempted. If each DRU divisor is set
;;;                     to the corresponding per user share and safe-dru-threshold is set to 1.0, then tasks that
;;;                     consume resources in aggregate less than the user resource share will not be preempted.
;;;
;;; min-dru-diff: The minimal DRU difference required to make a preemption action. This is also the maximal 'unfairness'
;;;               Rebalancer is willing to tolerate.
;;;
;;; max-preemption: The maximum number of preemptions Rebalancer can make in one cycle.
;;; min-utilization-threshold: The minimal cluster utilization to trigger rebalancer. The idea is that the rebalancer should only run when the cluster is at high utilization. If the cluster is not at high utilization, its available resources should be used first before we perform any preemption.

;;; Before you read the code...Here are something you should know about
;;;

;;; A lot of the functions in this namespace takes the data structure in the old state and compute the data structure
