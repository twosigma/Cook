(defmacro deftraced
  "Creates a miniprofiler-traced version of a function.  Use like defn
  to wrap your function in clojure-miniprofiler/trace with the
  function's namespace and name as the trace name.

  Optionally, you can add the metadata key :untraced to provide a name
  for the untraced version of the function, if you need to use that in
  some contexts.  By default, the untraced version is not bound to
  anything public.

  Optionally, you can provide in the metadata
  map :custom-timing [call-type execute-type command-string-fn].  The
  call-type and execute-type should be strings, command-string-fn will
  be called with the created function's arguments and should return a
  string.  These three values will be provided to
  clojure-miniprofiler/custom-timing instead of using
  clojure-miniprofiler/trace (which is the default behavior).

  Example:

      (deftraced ^{:untraced foo-bare}
        foo
        ([x] (+ x 2))
        ([x y] (* x y)))

  is roughly equivalent to:

      (defn foo-bare
        ([x] (+ x 2))
        ([x y] (* x y)))
      (defn foo [& args]
        (clojure-miniprofiler/trace
         \"my-ns/foo\"

  Example:

      (deftraced ^{:custom-timing [\"datomic\" \"query\" #(str %2)]}
        run-db-query
        [db query]
        (q query db))

  is roughly equivalent to:

      (defn run-db-query
        [db query]
        (clojure-miniprofiler/custom-timing
