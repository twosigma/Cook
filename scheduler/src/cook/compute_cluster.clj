; There's an ugly race where the core cook scheduler can kill a job before it tries to launch it.
; What happens is:
;   1. In launch-matched-tasks, we write instance objects to datomic for everything that matches,
;      we have not submitted these to the compute cluster backends yet.
;   2. A kill command arrives to kill the job. The job is put into completed.
;   3. The monitor-tx-queue happens to notice the job just completed. It sees the instance written in step 1.
;   4. We submit a kill-task to the compute cluster backend.
;   5. Kill task processes. There's not much to do, as there's no task to kill.
;   6. launch-matched-tasks now visits the task and submits it to the compute cluster backend.
;   7. Task executes and is not killed.
;
; At the core the bug is an atomicity bug. The intermediate state of written-to-datomic but not yet sent (via launch-task)
; to the backend. We work around this race by having a lock around of all launch-matched-tasks that contains the database
; update and the submit to kubernetes. We re-use the same lock to wrap kill-task to force an ordering relationship, so
; that kill-task must happen after the write-to-datomic and launch-task have been invoked.
;
; ComputeCluster/kill-task cannot be invoked before we write the task to datomic. If it is invoked after the write to
; datomic, the lock ensures that it won't be acted upon until after launch-task has been invoked on the compute cluster.
;
; So, we must grab this lock before calling kill-task in the compute cluster API. As all of our invocations to it are via
; safe-kill-task, we add the lock there.
