      This check is run synchronously with jobs submisison and MUST respond within 2 seconds, and should ideally return within
      100ms, or less. Furthermore, if multiple jobs are submitted in a batch (which may contain tens to hundreds to
      thousands of jobs), the whole batch of responeses MUST complete within the HTTP timeout. We set ourselves a lower timeout;

      {:status :deferred :cache-expires-at <DateTime to expire> :message 'reason'}

      This check is run just before a job is about to launch, and MUST return within milliseconds, without blocking
      (If you don't have have a definitive result, return a retry a few tens of milliseconds later)

      If the return value is :status :accepted, the job is considered ready to launch right now.
