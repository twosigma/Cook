;; This namespace is dangerously similar to cook.share (it was copied..)
;; it isn't obvious what the abstraction is, but there must be one.

;; As part of the pool migration, count was migrated from a field on the share entity
;; to a resource. This was because the share and quota entities had an identity uniqueness
;; for the username attribute, and it was decided that it was cleaner to maintain that
;; constraint and add the pool to the resource entities (as opposed to adding pool to the
;; quote or share and making username non-unique.) Since users can have different count
;; quotas in different pools, we moved count to a resource. There was some precedent for
;; non-mesos resource types (uri) already so it seemed like a reasonable compromise.
