      ; Invariants:
      ;   handle-pod-completed/handle-pod-killed/handle-pod-started: These are callbacks invoked when kubernetes has moved
      ;       to a new state. They handle writeback to datomic only. handle-pod-killed is called in all of the weird
      ;       kubernetes states that are not expected to occur, while handle-pod-completed is invoked in all of the
      ;       normal exit states (including exit-with-failure). I.e., these MUST only be invoked if cook expected state is not
      ;       in a terminal state. These functions return new cook-expected-state-dict's so should be invoked last in almost
      ;       all cases. (However, in a few cases, (delete-pod ? ?) can be invoked afterwards. It deletes the key from
      ;       the cook expected state completely. Should only be invoked if we're in a :missing cook-expected-state.)
      ;
      ;   log-weird-state can be called at any time to indicate we're in a weird state and extra logging is warranted.
      ;
      ;   We always end with one of handle-pod-completed/handle-pod-killed/handle-pod-started or delete-pod.
      ;
      ;   We always update datomic first (with pod-has-* pod-was-*), etc, then we update kubernetes so we can handle restarts.
      ;
      ;   (delete-pod ? ?) is only valid when the kubernetes pod is in a terminal-state.
      ;
      ;   Note that we have release semantics. We could fail to process any operation. This means that, where relevant, we
      ;     first write to datomic, then change into the next step. We thus show some intermediate states in the machine
      ;     that seem like they could be skipped.
      ;
      ;   In the (:completed,*) states, we delete from datomic, transitioning into (:completed,:missing) and thence to (:missing, :missing)
      ;     when we're in a terminal pod state.
      ;
      ;   We delete a pod if and only if the pod is in a terminal (or unknown) state.
      ; In some cases, we may mark mea culpa retries (if e.g., the node got reclaimed, so the pod got killed). In weird cases, we always need to mark mea culpa retries.
