== Overview

The Job Scheduler Rest API makes the Job Scheduling capabilities of Cook available for general purpose batch computing applications. This documents the HTTP based REST scheduler API.

[NOTE]
====
This API is designed to build applications. It is not meant for command line job submission of ad hoc jobs, nor does it provide utilities for tracking job status.
====

When using the Cook REST API, you're expected to track your jobs with your own database.
For example, at Two Sigma, we just use an additional Datomic database to track higher-level data models that use these jobs.
When using this API, your client should first persist the new job's uuid to its own database before submitting it to Cook.
This way, if your request ends with a timeout or indeterminate result, you can try to resubmit the job with the same uuid.
If the job was created successfully, the second submission will fail with an error message telling you that the first submission worked.
This API is fundamentally idempotent, and built for high reliability at scale.

If you are building an application on the JVM, you can use the Cook Jobsystem API directly (see JavaDoc).
The Cook Jobsystem API currently handles the job uuid management and resubmission;
however, it doesn't yet have hooks to persist these jobs to a database.

=== Disclaimer

The Cook Scheduler assumes all batch jobs are idempotent, that is, running an instance of a job several times will not impact the result.
If this isn't the case for your workload, the Cook Scheduler may not be a good fit.
Also, the Cook scheduler will rarely run multiple instances of a job at the same time.
This was a deliberate design decision to ensure that jobs are scheduled with the minimum possible latency, rather than rarely failing to schedule a job for 5-10 minutes.

=== Authentication for Job Submission

Cook currently requires all requests to be "authenticated".
Currently, Cook currently supports 3 different mechanisms for authentication:

`:http-basic`::
  This is the easiest authenication mode to get started with.
  Currently, there's no support for passwords--all passwords are accepted, which means that clients should be honest.
  Not that we have anything against password verification--pull requests welcome!

`:kerberos`::
  If you're already using Kerberos in your environment, this is a very convenient option for authenticating Cook requests.
  You'll need to set the `KRB5_KTNAME` environment variable for the cook process.
  You'll also need to set the `:hostname` and `:dns-name` correctly for the Kerberos service credential you passed via `KRB5_KTNAME`.
  TODO: you can't actually configure hostname or dns-name; these need to be reenabled for configuration.

`:one-user`::
  When you enable the `:one-user` authentication scheme, you provide the username that you'd like all jobs to run as.
  Note that this mode is meant for development only, since you can't take advantage of any of the fairness features of Cook without multiple users.

[WARNING]
====
In order to successfully launch a job, the user that the job is submitted to run as must exist on all the slaves that Cook might use.
You'll see tasks fail with the Mesos message "executor terminated", and in the slave log, you'll see a message about "Failed to chown executor directory".
You should make sure to use a user that's configured on all slaves.
====

=== HTTP Endpoints

This section lists the set of methods available in the Scheduler API.
The Scheduler endpoint provides the ability to **launch**, **track** and **delete** jobs on your Mesos cluster.

==== Launch a Job

`POST /rawscheduler` (also requires a JSON body)

The request body is list of job maps with each entry containing a map of the following:

.Request JSON Schema
[options="header"]
|====
|JSON Key | Type | Description
|`uuid` | string | a user provided UUID for tracking and referring to the job.
|`command` | string | the command to run
|`name` | string | name of the job
|`priority` | integer | priority of the job. Should be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
|`max_retries` | integer | the maximum number of retries
|`max_runtime` | long | the maximum running time of the job in milliseconds. An instance that runs for more than max_runtime will be killed and job will be retried.
|`cpus` | double | number of requested cpus.
|`mem` | double | MB of requested memory.
|`ports` | integer | Number of ports that should be opened for the job.
|`uris` | list of URI objects | A list of URIs that will be fetched into the container before launch.
|`env` | JSON map | A map of environment variables to be provided to the job.
|====

.URI JSON Schema (see http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/fetcher/[the Mesos docs] for details)
[options="header"]
|====
|JSON Key | Type | Description
|`value` | string | The URI to fetch. Supports everything the Mesos fetcher supports, i.e. http://, https://, ftp://, file://, hdfs://
|`executable` | boolean | Should the URI have the executable bit set after download?
|`extract` | boolean | Should the URI be extracted (must be a tar.gz, zipfile, or similar)
|`cache` | boolean | Mesos 0.23 and later only: should the URI be cached in the fetcher cache?

.Possible response codes
[options="header"]
|====
|Code | HTTP Meaning | Possible reason
|201 | Created | Job has been successfully created.
|400 | Malformed | This will be returned if the UUID is already used or the requst syntax is not correct.
|401 | Not Authorized | Returned if authentication fails or user is not authorized to run jobs on the system.
|422 | Unprocessable Entity | Returned if there is an error committing jobs to the Cook database.

==== Query Status of a Job

`GET /rawscheduler?job=:uuid(&job=:uuid)*`

[TIP]
====
You must provide at least one uuid to the `job` argument, but you can repeat the `job` argument as many times as you'd like to batch the request.
====

The request provides a list of jobs that are UUIDs that have been previously created; these uuids are sent as query parameters.
Jobs can only be in 3 states: `waiting`, `running`, or `completed`.
This is because a job is supposed to run until it's finished--you can determine whether the job succeeded or failed by looking at its instances.
Instances can be in 4 states: `unknown`, `running`, `success`, or `failed`.
Instances are only launched when Cook recieves a resource offer; the `unknown` state covers the period between finding an offer and Mesos notifying that the job launched successfully.
The `running` status indicates that the instance is still in progress; `success` and `failed` are based on the status of the task;
typically, a command that returned an exit code of 0 will have status `success` and `failed` otherwise.

Since a job could have multiple instances that run concurrently, it's possible to have both successful and failed instances of a completed job.
Thus, it's up to the user to determine whether the job achieved the desired effects.
The response body contains the following:

.Response Body Schema
[options="header"]
|====
|`command`|  The command submitted
|`uuid` | the job UUID
|`cpus` | the number of CPUs requested
|`mem` | the amount of memory requested
|`framework_id` | the Mesos framework ID of cook
|`status` |  the status of the job
|`instances` | a list of job instance maps (see <<instance_maps>>)
|====

Where each instance contains a map with the following keys:

[[instance_maps]]
.Job Instance Schema
|====
|`start_time` | milliseconds since Unix epoch (will be absent if job hasn't started)
|`end_time` | milliseconds since Unix epoch (will be absent if job hasn't ended)
|`task_id` | Mesos task id
|`hostname` | the host that the instance ran on
|`ports` | the ports that were opened for the instance
|`slave_id` | Mesos slave_id
|`executor_id` | Mesos executor_id
|`status` | current status of the instance; could be `unknown`, `running`, `success`, or `failed`
|`output_url` | See <<using_output_url>>, (will be absent if the agent the job was run on is unable to return the necessary data, e.g. it is offline)
|====

[[using_output_url]]
.Using the `output_url`
[TIP]
====
The `output_url` allows you directly connect to the machine that is running or ran an instance and download arbitrary files from that instance's sandbox over HTTP.
A common question is how to use the `output_url` of an instance to inspect and retrieve files from that instance.
Suppose you wished to download the file `foo.txt` which was written to the root of the sandbox.
Then, you would request the HTTP resource `"$output_url/foo.txt&offset=0"`.
If you wanted the file `logs/data.log`, you'd request `"$output_url/logs/data.log&offset=0"`.
The URL will return a JSON object with 2 fields: `data`, which is the requested data, and `length`, which is the length of the `data` field.

The `output_url` API also supports pagination.
Rather than always specifying `offset=0`, you can use whatever `offset` and `length` parameters you'd like, allowing you to download arbitrary slices of the files.
Since the returned data always includes its length, a client can maintain a local offset and repeatedly poll for only the latest data.

Don't forget that Mesos periodically garbage collects output directories--jobs should archive their results to a longer-term data store if longer-term access is neccessary.
====

The response will include Job details listed below:

.Possible response codes
[options="header"]
|====
|Code | HTTP Meaning | Possible reason
|400 | Malformed | This will be returned if non UUID values are passed as jobs
|403 | Forbidden | This will be returned the supplied UUIDs don't correspond to valid jobs.
| 404 | Not Found | The Job instance cannot be found.
| 200 | OK | The job and its instances were returned
|====

==== Delete a Job

This method will change the status of the job to "completed" and kill all the running instances of the job through `killTask` call to Mesos.
Note the instances might not be killed immediately--during extreme network issues, it could take 20-30 minutes for jobs to be fully killed, because the `killTask` won't be resent until the periodic instance reaper runs again.
The behavior of `killTask` depends on the implementation of the executor.
When using the Mesos default command line executor, it will first send `SIGTERM` and then `SIGKILL`.

`DELETE /rawscheduler?job=:uuid(&job=:uuid)*`

[TIP]
====
The `DELETE` verb also accepts multiple job uuids, just like `GET`.
====

.Possible response codes
[options="header"]
|====
|Code | HTTP Meaning | Possible reason
|204 | No Content | The job has been marked for termination.
|400 | Malformed | This will be returned if non UUID values are passed as jobs
|403 | Forbidden | This will be returned the supplied UUIDs don't correspond to valid jobs.
|====
